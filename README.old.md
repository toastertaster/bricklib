# Brick Layout for C++

***Distributed Performance-portable Stencil Compuitation - [Documentation@bricks.run](https://bricks.run)***

## Requirements

* *C++14* compatible compiler
* OpenMP
* MPI library
* CMake
* **Optional** backends
    * *CUDA*
    * *OpenCL*
    * *SYCL*
    * *HIP* **WIP**

## Building and running

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a build directory inside the source tree `mkdir build`
3. Create build configuration `cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
4. Build different test cases using `make <testname>`

For description of the test cases see [here](docs/testcases.md).

## Using the brick template

The brick template consists of 3 part:

* `Brick`: declare brick data structure
* `BrickInfo`: an adjacency list that describes the relations between bricks
* `BrickStorage`: a chunk of memory for storing bricks

The behavior of such templated data structures are as normal: they do not require the use of code generator to function;
provide a fallback way of writing code for compute & data movement.

## Stencil Expression Description

Stencil expression for code generator are specified using [Python library](docs/stencilExpr.md). Code generator provide 
optimization and vectorization support for different backend.

The code generation are carried out by CMake wrapper automatically. For details, see [Codegen Integration]().

# Dimension Ordering

Template arguments & code ordering is contiguous dimension last. Dimension arrays are contiguous at 0 (contiguous first).


## Directory & Files

* `include` and `src` contains the brick library headers and library files.
* `docs` various documents
* `cmake` CMake module file
* Included test cases are split into 4 folders:
    * `stencils` contains different stencils and related initialization code used by all tests as needed
    * `single` for single node (no MPI)
    * `weak` for weak scaling or strong scaling with one-level decomposition (one subdomain per rank)
    * `strong` for strong scaling with two-level decomposition (multiple fixed-sized subdomains per rank)

A large portion of the brick library is entirely based on templates and can be included as a header only library.
